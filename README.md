# My Typescript Course

This repo is used to store everything i learnt while taking a typescript course i recently did on frontend masters with [Mike North](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/mike-north/). This repo serves as a documentation where i will keep document everything I learn on typescript and will also serve as a reference point for me whenever i need to refresh

> There is not plan to public the articles in this repo at the moment as some of the sentences in it are not in my own words. Also for reference please note that docs here doesn't include intermediate typescript stuffs.
